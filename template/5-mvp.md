# The MVP

## Personas and Scenarios

#### Target users:
- **Social Media Users and Content Creators:** Individuals who use social media platforms regularly to connect and share experiences.
- **Travelers:** Those who seek unique local experiences in different cities.
- **Local Explorers:** Residents who want to discover hidden gems and interesting spots in their own city.

**Key Persona:** Frequent social media users are the primary target due to their high engagement levels and potential to drive content creation and interaction.

#### High-Level Scenarios:

- **Completing Challenges:** Users earn rewards by visiting nearby locations, enhancing their engagement.
- **Word of mouth**: A user is hanging out with a friend. Looking for any interesting activities nearby, he opens the app to browse posts. Curious, the friend user asks about the app and then tries it out for himself.

## Features Outside the Scope

For the MVP, the focus is on core functionalities that drive user engagement and retention. Additional features will be added in subsequent updates to enhance the user experience and expand the app's capabilities.


1. **Profile Picture Customization**
   - **Reason for Deferment:** Customization features like profile picture uploads were postponed to streamline the MVP development process. Incorporating such features would require additional development resources to support image uploading, resizing, and storage, which could extend the timeline and complicate the initial app release. Similary to media support, this feature would also introduce moderation challenges.
   - **Future Integration:** Planned for a subsequent update to enhance user personalization and identity within the app. This delay ensures that our development team can focus on delivering a solid, stable, and user-friendly initial release, setting a strong foundation for future enhancements.

2. **Heat Map of Trending Areas**
   - **Reason for Deferment:** Requires a substantial user base to generate meaningful data. Premature introduction could lead to misleading or sparse data displays.
   - **Future Integration:** Aimed for integration once active user thresholds exceed 50,000, providing users with a visual representation of hotspots to explore, thereby driving engagement and exploration.

3. **Comments Tree Structure**
   - **Reason for Deferment:** Reduces complexity in initial development. A linear comment structure simplifies interactions during the early stages of the platform.
   - **Future Integration:** Nested comments will be introduced in a later phase to improve conversation tracking and readability, enhancing discussions and engagement on posts.


### Roadmap for features expansion

The roadmap for Proxima includes the following key milestones:

0. **MVP Development**: Focus on core features for initial launch.
1. **Launch**: Release the app in Switzerland, with EPFL students as target users, to establish a user base and gather feedback.
2. **Stability and Performance Improvements**: Address any issues identified post-launch and optimize the app for better performance.
3. **User Growth and Engagement**: Focus on increasing user base and enhancing user interactions.
4. **Feature Expansion**: Introduce additional features like heat maps, and nested comments.
5. **Community Building**: Implement group features to foster community engagement and collaboration.
