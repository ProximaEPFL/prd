# Analysis of the Situation

Currently, most social media platforms are designed to encourage the sharing and consumption of virtual content.

While this facilitates easy sharing of information, it also confines users to the virtual environment of social media. This can lead to physical isolation from the real world. In extreme cases, users may become dependent on social media, neglecting their surroundings and real-life interactions.

Applications that aim to provide a more outdoor experience through location-based logic are mostly designed for gaming purposes (e.g. Pokemon Go) or specific sports (e.g. running trackers), and do not offer a viable alternative for content sharing. These apps lack the focus on meaningful social interaction and content exchange, limiting their effectiveness in promoting real-world engagement.

### Competitors

The current main competitors are mainstream social media platforms (such as Reddit and Instagram) and location-based applications like Geocaching apps. However, these competitors either focus solely on social interaction or on location features in a fully gamified manner. None of them truly combine social interaction with location-based features. Proxima aims to bridge this gap by integrating both elements, offering a unique and engaging user experience.

### Complementary Products

The market also offers numerous complementary products to our application. Any product that facilitates travel or encourages outdoor experiences in a passive manner can serve as a complementary asset. For example, travel applications such as Google Maps can assist users in discovering new posts. Similarly, activity trackers can motivate users to engage in outdoor activities and potentially integrate their physical exercise with discovering posts on our app.
