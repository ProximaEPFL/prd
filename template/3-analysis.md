# Analysis of the Situation

Currently, most social media platforms are designed to encourage the sharing and consumption of virtual content.

While this facilitates easy sharing of information, it also confines users to the virtual environment of social media. This can lead to physical isolation from the real world. In extreme cases, users may become dependent on social media, neglecting their surroundings and real-life interactions.

Applications that aim to provide a more outdoor experience through location-based logic are mostly designed for gaming purposes and do not offer a viable alternative for content sharing. These apps lack the focus on meaningful social interaction and content exchange, limiting their effectiveness in promoting real-world engagement.
