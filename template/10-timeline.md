# Timeline/Resource Planning

## Execution Roadmap

Planning an efficient schedule will prevent us from making time-wasting mistakes and reduce costs. The timeline is organized over a 8 week period, marked with 3 milestones. Main guidelines will ensure that the whole development process complies with the MVP requirements. A team of 6 people will be in charge of delivering a product ready for initial rollout: 2 backend developers, 2 frontend developers, 1 UI/UX designer and 1 project manager. The major points dealt with during this development process are setup, development, testing and rollout.
