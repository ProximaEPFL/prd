# The Value Proposition

Proxima provides a solution to this problem by uniquely combining content sharing and outdoor experiences in an intuitive and easy-to-use mobile application. The concept is simple: to share or consume content, users must physically go to the specified location to access it. This encourages real-world exploration and interaction, promoting a healthier balance between virtual engagement and physical activity.

On the user side, the incentive for using the application emerges through two main components:

- Sharing content based on a common location-based context
- Discovering content in a treasure-hunter fashion through challenges

In Proxima, all content—posts, comments, and interactions—is intrinsically linked to the location where it was created. This establishes a shared context among users, which is unique to Proxima. Unlike other social networks, where context is often artificially created through threads or hashtags, Proxima ensures that users sharing content have a common "background" based on their physical presence at the same location. This commonality fosters a sense of connection between users, enabling them to interact based on shared experiences.

The second crucial aspect of Proxima is its engaging approach to content consumption. Proxima introduces daily challenges where users must "hunt" for posts to read and earn Centauri points. This gamified element creates a friendly competition among users to accumulate the most points. This treasure-hunter experience not only makes content discovery more engaging but also motivates users to explore their surroundings actively.


Regarding customers, Proxima targets businesses where physical interaction is crucial, such as shops and restaurants. Proxima will offer these businesses a location-based advertisement system, bringing several benefits:

- **Relevance**: This ensures that advertisements are relevant to the users who encounter them, as the ads are tied to the users' current location.
- **Proximity**: Because the advertising is location-based, users will be near the business when they see the ad. This significantly reduces the effort required for users to visit the business, resulting in a higher conversion rate of potential customers for advertisers.

These factors make Proxima particularly appealing to physical businesses, as it allows them to reach an audience that is both relevant and physically able to visit their location, all at a low conversion cost.

In particular, the locality of the advertisement makes Proxima especially attractive for event organizers. By integrating specific time-limited experiences within a certain area, Proxima facilitates efficient promotion of events such as festivals, conventions, and more. 

In contrast, traditional social media advertisements may be shown to users who are hundreds of kilometers away from the relevant location, making the ads less effective. This localized advertisement system contributes to the unique environment that Proxima aims to provide, enhancing both user experience and business engagement.
