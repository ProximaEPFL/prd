# Functional Requirements

*Max 3 pages.*

*List the key features of the MVP precisely.*

### User Authentication
Users must be able to authenticate into their account to user the app. For this, we use pre-existing infrastructure, such as google authentication.

### Post Creation
Users must be able to create posts containing text. These posts will have embedded location data.

### Location-Based Feed
Users must be able to see in a feed all of the posts that were made inside of a 100m radius around their current position. This feed will have different sorting options.

### Commenting System
Users must be able to leave comments on posts. 

### Offline Mode
Users must be able to see as much data as possible even when they are not online. Their user profile, own posts and comments and current challenges should be cached locally.

### Voting System
Users should be able to upvote or downvote posts and comments.

### Posts and comments management
Users should always be able see all of their own posts and comments, and delete them if they want to. Deleting a post automatically deletes all the comments and information related to it.

### Centauri Points
Users gain Centauri points by completing challenges. These provide cosmetic improvements on their profile. Users can see how much points they have in their profile as well as in a leaderboard, where they can compare themselves to everyone.

### Challenges
Users get 3 challenges everyday. These are randomly picked from posts in their area. To complete these challenges, they have to travel to the post and open it.

### Map Integration
Users should be able to see all the nearby posts, all of their own posts and all their challenges on a map. It should be simple to navigate back and forth from the map to the other pages.

*Include appropriate architectural diagrams.*

*Describe key internal functionality.*
